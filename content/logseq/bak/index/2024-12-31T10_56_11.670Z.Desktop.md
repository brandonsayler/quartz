This is a work in progress website, forked from the [Quartz]((https://quartz.jzhao.xyz)) repo, and inspired by [Arunim Agarwal](https://garden.arunim.fyi/). Quartz allows you to simply edit [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files to edit your websiteâ€”it takes care of the rest. Most people edit with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but I edit with [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), my favorite do-it-all software. This website is currently hosted publicly in a [Github repo](https://github.com/brandonsayler/quartz).

See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started.

So if I add tags.. like [[claude]] then will they show up once I save? Okay awesome they do.
