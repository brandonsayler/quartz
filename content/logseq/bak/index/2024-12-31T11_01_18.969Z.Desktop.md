This is a work in progress website, forked from the [Quartz]((https://quartz.jzhao.xyz)) repo, and inspired by [Arunim Agarwal](https://garden.arunim.fyi/). Quartz allows you to simply edit [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files to edit your website—it takes care of the rest. Most people edit with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but I edit with [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), my favorite do-it-all software. This website is currently hosted publicly in a [Github repo](https://github.com/brandonsayler/quartz).

Currently, I don't know exactly what I'm doing with this site. In the past, I have written on [Substack](sayler.substack.com). I plan to continue to write on Substack, but I want a place for me to write smaller things, half-baked unpolished things, silly things. That will be the main function of this website.

My friend Arunim has two websites—his "digitial garden", and then a [small personal website](https://arunim.fyi/#). This seems to be the path most people take with Quartz. However, I think taking a minimalist approach and having everything on this site would be really cool! Oh, except I said I would still publish to Substack... so I don't know. I'll think about it more.

I don't know if I should prattle on here about what else I want on this website, or if I should make a separate page. Maybe I'll do both. Sure, both. Some quick bullets:
