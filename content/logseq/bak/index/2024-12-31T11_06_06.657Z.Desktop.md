This is a work in progress website, forked from the [Quartz]((https://quartz.jzhao.xyz)) repo, and inspired by [Arunim Agarwal](https://garden.arunim.fyi/). Quartz allows you to simply edit [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files to edit your website—it takes care of the rest. Most people edit with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but I edit with [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), my favorite do-it-all software. This website is currently hosted publicly in a [Github repo](https://github.com/brandonsayler/quartz).

Currently, I don't know exactly what I'm doing with this site. In the past, I have written on [Substack](sayler.substack.com). I plan to continue to write on Substack, but I want a place for me to write smaller things, half-baked unpolished things, silly things. That will be the main function of this website.

My friend Arunim has two websites—his "digitial garden", and then a [small personal website](https://arunim.fyi/#). This seems to be the path most people take with Quartz. However, I think taking a minimalist approach and having everything on this site would be really cool! Oh, except I said I would still publish to Substack... so I don't know. I'll think about it more.

I don't know if I should prattle on here about what else I want on this website, or if I should make a separate page. Maybe I'll do both. Sure, both. Some quick bullets:
- okay bullets look kind of strange, I'll have to fix that
- as in, the spacing between the first bullet "Some quick bullets:" is way too much

Scratch bullets. I'm going to make a separate page. If you'd like to read more about my plans for the sight, read [[quartz design]]. If you'd like to read more [[about me]] (should I keep pages lowercase?) click on the link. If you missed it, it's [[about me]]. Else, I'm going to be steadily uploading pages that are from my regular Logseq graph (I'm not uploading my normal Logseq graph for all to see lol). Clikc on explorers, then pages to see all the pages. You can also click on the graph view. I'm going to find a way to get rid of the "logseq" and potentially the "journals" folder too (although the journals folder could be useful to tag pages with start dates and update dates, and then you could clik on a date to see what was written on what day. I don't know).
